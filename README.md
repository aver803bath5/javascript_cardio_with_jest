# JavasScript Cardio With Jest

This is a repo containing my solutions to the [JavaScript Cardio](https://github.com/bradtraversy/javascript_cardio) quetions created by [bradtraversy](https://github.com/bradtraversy) who is a very nice guy having lot of JavasScript tutorials on YouTube.

And I use Jest to test all the solutions. The code coverage maybe not 100%. But I use the questions to practice Jest anyway.

By the way, all solutions are developed with TDD methods.
